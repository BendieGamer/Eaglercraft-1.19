## Introduction
This server is a modified version of the original 1.8.8 eaglercraft server supporting some functionality of minecraft 1.19 please note that some mobs and textures may be missing from the game.
<br>
<br>
This project was made by `@CaenJones` and `@DerpLord3264` with thanks to the original eaglercraft developers.

## System Setup (Linux)
After installation of the server it is important to edit `server.properties` and take the config out of online more by setting it to `false` this way players can connect to the server without an official mojang client ðŸ™‚
<br>
<br>
For this tutorial, we will be using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. First of all, java is required to run bungeecord and the server file. To do this, we will need to run the following commands:
<br>
<br>
`sudo apt install default-jdk && sudo apt install default-jre -y`
<br>
<br>
## Installing The Server
Now, we need to clone the server repo using `git`. Please run the following command:
<br>
<br>
`git clone https://github.com/CaenJones/EaglercraftX-1.19-Server`
<br>
<br>
Now, open 2 terminal tabs in the new server directory and paste in the following snipits:
<br>
<br>
first tab: `cd server && sudo java -jar server.jar`
<br>
<br>
You may need to edit the EULA.txt and change a value to `true` before running the next command:
<br>
<br>
second tab: `cd bungee && sudo java -jar bungee.jar`
<br>
<br>
## Making Server Public
Great! Now, you need to forward ports  `8081` and `25565` and navigate to your servers public ip [server-ip:8081]. The server welcome page should be displayed. Congrats on running your own server!

## Installing Plugins
In order to install plugins, navigate to `server > plugins` and `bungee > plugins`. You will need to clone the initial [plugin-name.jar] file as well as creating a separate directory in the plugins folder in order to store the additional data. Then just restart the server and the plugin should be running!

## FAQ
### Can I still find and craft 1.19 items?
Yes, you are able to mine ores like netherite and craft things like shields. The items will act normally, however the textures may not match.
### What about mobs? Will they still behave normally?
Yes, most mobs have been matched to their closest prexisting characters or models with a nametag identifier. Their drops and stats will remain by the 1.19 standard.
### Can I find new naturally generated structures?
Yes although they may not have matching blocks or layouts.
### Will there continue to be updates?
Hell yeah!
